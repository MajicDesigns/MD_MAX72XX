\mainpage Arduino LED Matrix Library
The Maxim 72xx LED Controller IC
--------------------------------
The MAX7219/MAX7221 are compact, serial input/output display drivers that
interface microprocessors to 7-segment numeric LED displays of up to 8 digits,
bar-graph displays, or 64 individual LEDs. Included on-chip are a BCD code-B
decoder, multiplex scan circuitry, segment and digit drivers, and an 8x8 static
RAM that stores each digit.

A 4-wire serial interface (SPI) allows the devices to be cascaded, with
communications passed through the first device in the chain to all others. Individual
elements may be addressed and updated without rewriting the entire display.

This library implements functions that allow the MAX72xx to be used
for LED matrices (64 individual LEDs), allowing the programmer to use the LED
matrix as a pixel device, displaying graphics elements much like any other
pixel addressable display.

The Library
-----------
The library implements functions that allow the MAX72xx to be used
for LED matrices (64 individual LEDs), allowing the programmer to use the LED
matrix as a pixel device, displaying graphics elements much like any other
pixel addressable display.

In this scenario, it is convenient to abstract out the concept of the hardware device
and create a uniform and consistent pixel address space, with the libraries determining
device and device-element address. Similarly, control of the devices should be uniform
and abstracted to a system level.

The library still retains flexibility for device level control, should the developer
require, through the use of overloaded class methods.
___

Conditional Compilation Switches
--------------------------------
The library allows the run time code to be tailored through the use of compilation
switches. The compile options start with USE_ and are documented in the section
related to the main header file MD_MAX72xx.h.

_NOTE_: Compile switches must be edited in the library header file. Arduino header file
'mashing' during compilation makes the setting of these switches from user code
completely unreliable.

\page pageConnect System Connections
Connections to the Arduino Board (SPI interface)
------------------------------------------------
The modules are connected through a 4-wire serial interface (SPI), and devices are cascaded,
with communications passed through the first device in the chain to all others. The Arduino
should be connected to the IN side of the first module in the chain.

The Arduino interface is implemented with either
+ The hardware SPI interface, or
+ 3 arbitrary digital outputs that are passed through to the class constructor.

The AVR hardware SPI interface is fast but fixed to predetermined output pins. The more general
software interface uses the Arduino shiftOut() library function, making it slower but allows the
use of arbitrary digital pins to send the data to the device. Which mode is enabled depends
on the class constructor used.

The Arduino interface is implemented with 3 digital outputs that are passed through to
the class constructor. The digital outputs define the SPI interface as follows:
- DIN (MOSI) - the Data IN signal shifts data into the display module. Data is loaded into
the device's internal 16-bit shift register on CLK's rising edge.
- CLK (SCK) - the CLocK signal that is used to time the data for the device.
- LD (SS) - the interface is active when LoaD signal is LOW. Serial data are loaded into the
device shift register while LOAD is LOW and latched in on the rising edge.

The LD signal is used to select the entire device chain. This allows separate LD
outputs to control multiple displays sharing the same DIN and CLK signals. The
software needs to instantiate a separate object for each display.

The remaining interface pins are for +5V and GND. The power supply must be able to supply
enough current for the number of connected modules.
